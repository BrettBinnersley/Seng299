Hello everyone,

Take note of the emails above, hopefully I got them all correct but we can
confirm tomorrow in the lab.

If everyone has a google account, or has access to a google account that
they can use, or can set up a google account, that would be great as then
we can use a shared folder on google Drive to store any documents for the
course and can use google Docs to collaborate while writing the various
pieces of documentation like the requirements specification.

Tomorrow in the lab we can also set up a throwaway github org to keep track
of our repositories for this course and I or someone else can walk the
people unfamiliar with git through the basics and we can also figure out
what we're doing for staging and hosting.

Anyway see you all in the lab tomorrow.
